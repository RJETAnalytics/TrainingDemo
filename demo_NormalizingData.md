**Normalizing Data**

When analyzing data you will always be challenged with trying to compare two things that are unequal.  This could be:

- Two companies of unequal size
- Operational volume from two different periods of time
- The results from a test market versus the control markets

Normalizing measures in data analytics is the process of transforming those measures to a common range or scale so that we can compare the otherwise incomparable.  Examples include:

- Financial Ratios : Quick, Debt to Equity, Earnings Per Share
- Sports Statistics : Earned Run Average (ERA) in baseball, Player Efficiency Rating (PER) in basketball, Quarterback Rating (QBR) in football 
- Airline Specific :  Revenue Per Average Seat Mile (RASM), Costs per Block Hour, Daily Block Hours Per Available Aircraft
- Hospitality : Revenue Per Available Room (REVPAR)
- Distribution and Logistics : Perfect Order Rate (POR), Total Delivered Cost Per Unit (TDCP)

So always be aware of differences in scale when asked to develop measures or do comparisons and make sure you create metrics and analysis that will deliver quality results when the scale of the inputs changes.
